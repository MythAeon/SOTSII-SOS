# Save Our SOTS2
Original work: https://github.com/zerk-js/SOTSII-SOS

attempted to create diplomacy, no idea if these changes will work. 
the ai used to offer and accept the treaties in the debug window in test games.
changed the starting of the game to include all weights for the diplomatic actions, as the original files do not allow this and will crash the game when requesting a diplomatic action that has no weight.

do note that i am not an experience programmer, a noob at best. issues may be present.
last changes were from late 2019, and have not looked at it since then.
not currently working on this!
