[STANCE WEIGHTS]

x = Stance to weigh.
y = Relative chance of selecting this fleet type.

Not specifying a stance in a FleetTemplate will result in a fleet not being selectable for that stance.
-->

<!--
[SHIPS]
<Ship inclusion="v" amount="w" weaponRole="x" faction="y">z</Ship>

v = An inclusion type, see [INCLUSION TYPES].
w = Number of ships to build, for REQUIRED inclusion type only.
x = (Optional) Use a design with the specified weapon role.
y = (Optional) Faction requirement. 
z = A ship role, see [SHIP ROLES].
