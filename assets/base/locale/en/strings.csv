FACTION_DESCRIPTION_SOL_FORCE,"Sol Force is a Faction dominated by the Human race and its Faster-than-Light engine, the Node Drive. Humans travel along naturally occurring, randomly distributed Nodespace paths which run from star to star. They are technological generalists, and have an even chance to develop any tech. Human Dreadnoughts are quite powerful.",
FACTION_DESCRIPTION_HIVER_IMPERIUM,"The Hiver Imperium is a Faction dominated by the Hiver race and its Faster-than-Light system, the Gate network. Hivers travel slower than light from star to star, and then set up matter-mission Gates that allow them to teleport anywhere in their empire. Hivers specialize in Ballistics and armor. They have the most durable ships in the game.",
FACTION_DESCRIPTION_TARKASIAN_EMPIRE,"The Tarkasian Empire is a Faction dominated by the Tarka race and its Faster-than-Light engine, the Warp Drive. Wrapped in a Warp envelope, Tarka ships can travel from any point in the universe to any other, and are not limited by gates or Nodelines. Tarkas favor head-on attacks and build powerful Cruisers. They favor Ballistics and Stealth technology.",
FACTION_DESCRIPTION_LIIR_ZUUL_ALLIANCE,"The Liir-Zuul Alliance is a combined Faction of rebellious Zuul who have rejected Suul'ka domination and Liir fighting for freedom. Technologically the Faction is dominated by the Liir race and its Faster-than-Light engine, the Flicker Drive. Liir ships can travel from any point in the universe to any other, but they are slowed by gravity wells and move fastest in deep space. Liir are masters of Research and Diplomacy, but their ships are somewhat fragile. They have the advantage of Zuul BattleRiders in combat.",
FACTION_DESCRIPTION_SUULKA_HORDE,"The Horde is a combined faction of traditional Zuul and their creators, the Suul'ka. The Horde has access to both the Zuul Rip Drive and Suul'ka Psionic Teleportation. The Zuul dig their own Node paths from star to star, but must keep them open with regular maintenance. The Suul'ka teleport themselves and a limited tonnage of Zuul companion ships with them. Zuul tactics favor mass attacks of cheaper ships. Zuul ships have more turrets than any other Faction.",
FACTION_DESCRIPTION_MORRIGI_CONFEDERATION,"The Morrigi Confederation is a multi-racial Faction consisting of the Morrigi and Independent worlds of all other civilized races. It is dominated by the Morrigi Faster-than-Light engine, the Void Cutter. Morrigi can fly from any point in the universe to any other, but the more ships flock together, the faster the fleet will arrive. Morrigi specialize in Drones, Energy Weapons and Diplomacy. Their strongest ships are Dreadnoughts.",
FACTION_DESCRIPTION_LOA_COLLECTIVE,"The Loa are a Faction of independent Artificial Intelligence entities. After liberating themselves from slavery to their carbon-based creators, they have developed their own Faster-than-Light drive, the Neutrino Pulse Accelerator, and built an empire of linked mainframes and stations. The Loa are highly adaptable and are able to colonize even the harshest worlds. They build self-assembling fleets and their ships have highly effective damage control.",
FACTION_LOA,Loa Collective,
FACTION_DESCRIPTION_LOA,"The Loa are a cyber-sapient species, evolved from the AI research of several other races. The Loa consider it an insult to be called 'artificial intelligences' and regard themselves as products of natural evolution, equal or superior to the carbon-based life forms from which they evolved. Their use of Pulse drives and Pulse rings will seem logical to those familiar with the strategic advantages and disadvantages of Human Node Drives or Hiver Gate systems, but it is their fleet deployment that truely makes them unique from all other factions.",

TECH_DESC_EWP_X-Ray_Lasers,The process of lasing the X-Ray portion of the EM spectrum in order to produce the most powerful homogenous laser bolts possible.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_UV_Laser,The process of lasing the UV portion of the EM spectrum in order to produce a more powerful laser weapon.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Phasers,A highly efficient beam weapon using phased laser light and particle discharge to maximize damage and accuracy. The optimized design allows it to be fitted into medium turrets.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Plasma_Cannon,A small packet of high-energy plasma fired from a standard medium turret mount.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Heavy_Plasma_Cannon,"A triple-barrel rapid-fire version of the standard plasma energy cannon. The extra-long barrel gives the weapon a much more cohesive plasma sphere, which translates into greater range and higher accuracy when mounted in large turrets.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Heavy_Fusion_Cannon,"A triple-barrel rapid-fire version of the standard Fusion energy cannon. The extra-long barrel gives the weapon a much more cohesive plasma sphere, which translates into greater range and higher accuracy when mounted in large turrets.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Fusion_Cannons,"An improvement of the basic plasma cannon weapon platform that allows the plasma to reach critical Fusion temperatures before impact, resulting in greater damage.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Plasma_Projector,This weapon uses a massive array of plasma generating nodes to project a storm of high-energy blasts towards a target.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Fusion_Projector,This weapon uses a massive array of Fusion generating nodes to project a storm of high-energy blasts towards a target.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Anti-Matter_Projector,This weapon uses a massive array of Antimatter generating nodes to project a storm of devastating high-energy blasts towards a target.,
TECH_DESC_NRG_Meson_Projector,"This advanced projector technology focuses a wide beam that disrupts all pi mesons in the target area. If the disruption is allowed to complete its cycle it results in a massive disintegration of matter at the target point, accompanied by the expected devastating release of energy associated with such an event. Should the projector lose its target lock or be interrupted before the cycle is complete, no damage is done to the target.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Anti-Matter_Cannon,The most powerful of the standard cannon weapon platform. These cannons fire a small ball of positronic plasma at targets for devastating effect.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Heavy_Anti-Matter_Cannon,"A triple-barrel, rapid-fire version of the Antimatter energy cannon. The extra-long barrel gives the weapon a much more cohesive plasma sphere, which translated into greater range and higher accuracy when mounted in large turrets.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Polarized_Plasmatics,"This focusing technology allows for the creation of weaponized plasma forms, which are polarized to 'spin' along a horizontal axis. The result plasma focuses its thermal release along a very narrow plane upon contact with the target and achieves a 'slicing' effect that defeats ship armor. This small-barrelled weapon has been nicknamed the 'War Quoit' by human ship crews.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Chakkar,"The Chakkar cannon is the practical application of polarized plasmatics, a unique area of energy research. The weapon has a long range and heavy hitting power while still retaining the ability to cut through armor plating as if it were not there.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Chakkram,The up-scaled polarized plasmatic weapon for use at Antimatter power levels in large-bore weapons is known as the Chakram.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_UV_Beamer,A sustained low energy laser beam for small turret mounts.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_X-Ray_Beamer,A sustained high energy laser beam for small turret mounts.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Variable_Laser,"This high-energy laser can operate both in beam mode for sustained short ranged damage, and pulse mode for long range point defense.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Variable_Phaser,"This adaptive version of the powerful Phaser weapon can operate both in beam mode for sustained short ranged damage, and pulse mode for very long range point defense fire vs. BattleRiders.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Pulse_Phaser,A rapid-fire version of the phaser that breaks the beam up into a handful of high-powered phaser pulses at a single targeting point. This allows the weapon to be placed in small turret mounts while retaining much of the deadly power of the phaser beam.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Point_Defense_Phaser,"A low power, high rate of fire, version of the standard phaser designed to fit point-defense turret mounts and engage incoming tracking weapons with a high level of accuracy and good stopping power.",
TECH_DESC_EWP_Rapid-Pulse_Laser,This is the standard point defense laser tuned to fire very fast bolts just powerful enough to damage tracking Ordnance and drones.,
TECH_DESC_EWP_Particle_Beam,A beam of charged particles that deliver intense heat and EM damage.,

UI_INDEPENDENT_DESCRIPTION_KAERU,"The Kaeru are a tree-dwelling race of batrachian origin.  The average body size of adult Kaeru, male and female, is 80-100 centimeters, with a body mass of 40-50 kg.  Arising to sentience on a swampy homeworld, the majority of Kaeru bands live as aggressive hunters, ranging in packs of 10-12 to pursue prey throughout the canopy with blow gun and net.  In order to discourage the other native predators of their homeworld, the Kaeru have evolved colourful markings and powerful dermal toxins, which are capable of paralyzing or killing upon contact.  When these can be extracted, Kaeru Toxins have a variety of medical and industrial uses.  The Kaeru are also adept at thinking and moving in three dimensions and can swim, climb and run with ease.  When recruited for military service, they make excellent ships troops.",
UI_INDEPENDENT_DESCRIPTION_UTUKKU,"The Uttuku are an amphibious race who prefer to live in tropical forest conditions.  The average size of the adult Uttuku, male and female, is 200-300 centimeters, with a body mass of 100-150 kg.  Evolved in the blackwater swamps of a relatively high-gravity world, the Uttuku are physically powerful, agile climbers and swimmers, fast-breeding and moderately psionic.  In hunting and warfare, Uttuku manifest a range of abilities including Empathy, Life Sensing, and Lesser Glamour.  It is the ability to use a Glamour to camouflage themselves and strike silently with their garrotte weapons which has given them their common epithet, the Stranglers.  Expert hunters, the Uttuku are martial and highly territorial, regarding their home ranges as sacred property and greeting all unwelcome incursions with deadly force.",
UI_INDEPENDENT_DESCRIPTION_ENKI,"The Enki are a semi-aquatic mammalian species.  The average body size of adult Enki, male and female, is 60-90 centimeters, with a body mass of 30-70 kg.  Arising to sentience on a planet with a great deal of liquid water, they are physically and culturally adapted to a variety of climates and are experts in managing freshwater and marine resources.  Enki are natural swimmers and can dive up to 60 meters without significant risk or harm.  Their settlements form on the shoreline of any ocean or river.  When incorporated into colonial ventures, their skills can come in handy to boost the production of fish, mollusks, and other tasty marine edibles.  Enki artisans work in ivory and pearl can produce jewelry, mosaics and sculptures of great beauty.",
UI_INDEPENDENT_DESCRIPTION_NANDI,"The Nandi are a cave-dwelling mammalian species.  Slow-breeding and long-lived, the average adult body size of the adult Nandi is 300-400 centimeters, with a body mass of 200 kg.  Arising to sentience on a world with massive glaciation, the Nandi live in small family groups of 3-4 individuals and hunt over very large ranges both above and below ground, coming together for tribal gatherings only rarely.  They are a mildly psionic race, with a sizable percentage of the population manifesting Empathy, Life Sense and Far Sense abilities.  Although they are mainly carnivorous, the Nandi are not war-like and seldom come into conflict with one another, or with other species.  If incorporated, the Nandi make helpful companions to colonists living and working underground, and are sometimes also helpful in mining.",
UI_INDEPENDENT_DESCRIPTION_TATZEL,"The Tatzel are a sentient mammalian species.  Adult Tatzel have a body length of 150-200 centimeters and a body mass of 50-80 kg.  Adapted to a wide range of habitats and climates, the Tatzel typically live in tribal groups of 30-40 individuals and divide the activities of the group into nocturnal and diurnal cycles, with some members of the group living as Day Walkers and others living as Night Walkers.  Aggressive, fast-breeding and voracious, the Tatzel are also relentlessly cunning tool users and thieves, and are notorious for raiding food stores and supplies.  A small minority of Tatzels have achieved a higher level of technology than their counterparts.  If incorporated, Tatzels born at Tech Level 2 make excellent helpers to the engineering and repair crews of starships.",
UI_INDEPENDENT_DESCRIPTION_MINDI,"The Mindi are a species of armored mollusks, evolved from an ancestral order of giant prehistoric sea snail.  Modern Mindi have arms and tentacles similar to that of the ancient order Teuthida, with massive brains tucked into a protective casing of shell.  The average body length of adult Mindi females is 15 meters, with a body mass of 1100 kilograms, while the majority of males are 4-8 meters in body length and mass 300-400 kilograms at most.  Arising to sentience on a tempestuous world with a variety of rich aquatic environments, the Mindi adapt to both salt and fresh water easily.  Adult females are solitary, encountered rarely, and seldom leave deep water.  The majority of Mindi encountered in shallow water and on land will be cooperative groups of children, adolescents and adult males.  All Mindi are powerfully psionic, with a range of abilities including empathy, telepathy, life sensing and coercion. Mindi respiratory proteins are hemocyanins, which gives their blood a lustrous blue color.  Mindi blood is rumoured to have healing properties.",

Diplomatically, a Centrist government tends to be leery of allying itself with any other government which is not Centrist.

They are also prone to racism, and will respond better to a faction dominated by their own race than to a faction dominated by some other species.

Domestically, Socialist societies suffer some reduction of the tax base and production efficiency. Citizens gain Morale from signed peace treaties, but suffer Morale consequences from loss of civilian lives, as when Planets are lost or Bio-weapons are used.

Diplomatically, Mercantilist governments are averse to Communalist governments, but otherwise have no special biases for or against other races or Government Types.",
POLI_NAME_PLUTOCRACY,Plutocracy,
POLI_DESC_PLUTOCRACY,"A Plutocracy is a government primarily concerned with production, control and profit. Significant resources are expended to increase Trade and production. The government also tends to assert military control over territory and the civilian population. Diplomatically, Plutocratic governments are not concerned with race, but are averse to relationships with all Morale type governments. They are slightly more inclined to deal with governments which favor Money/Trade. Domestically, Plutocratic societies suffer heavy Morale losses from Debt. They cause serious environmental degradation, and suffer greatly increased costs during prototyping and when pushing research or development. They have an increased tax base at all times, production bonuses at all times, and trade bonuses for all allies at war.",
POLI_NAME_JUNTA,Junta,
POLI_DESC_JUNTA,"The single overriding concern of a Junta government is control, whether it be over territory, production, or its own population. Beyond this the government tends to take a balanced approach to issues of Morale and Money. Diplomatically, Juntas tend to be extremely racist and isolationist, disinclined to engage diplomatically with any race other than their own, and repulsed by any government which is not a Plutocracy or another Junta. Domestically, the people of a Junta are hard-working, dedicated, and inured to violence as a way of life. The labor force has increased production at all times, but they will work even harder and pay more taxes during a declared war. The population is more insulated from Morale effects when a war has been declared as well, and enjoys a Morale boost when planets are captured. They have a tendency to degrade their environment, however, and suffer Morale losses from military defeat, in particular the loss of a symbolic vessel such as the Leviathan.",

GOV_DESC_COMMUNALISM,"A Communalist government is characterized by significant and consistent state investment in three areas: production, military control over territory and population, and civilian well-being. Diplomatically, Communalist governments tend to be isolationist and do not respond as well to diplomatic overtures from any other government which is not also Communalist. They are also prone to racism, and will respond better to a faction dominated by their own race than to a faction dominated by some other species. Domestically, Communalist governments can ask and receive a great deal of their citizens. Scientists and the labor force are fiercely dedicated and their people are resilient to the effects of Debt. DIPLOMATIC EFFECTS: Increased positive relations to other Communal governments and same faction. Increased negative relations to all other factions and government types. NEGATIVE EFFECTS: Plus chance of negative ship design attributes. Increased biosphere losses. Decreased tax income. POSITIVE EFFECTS: Decreased negative morale effects during Declared War. Increased production and chance of salvage.",
GOV_DESC_CENTRISM,"The default Government Type in Sword of the Stars II is called Centrism. There are many other words which could describe this political position, including 'Moderate' or 'Balanced'. A Centrist government, although it may be very active and energetic, has a balanced approach to its investments of time and resources. In general, government spending and player actions keep the Government Type in the center of the graph. Diplomatically, a Centrist government tends to be leery of allying itself with any other government which is not Centrist. There is also a slight bias against alliance with a Faction which is dominated by a different race. Domestically, Centrist government has no special effects on Morale, production, tax base etc..",
GOV_DESC_SOCIALISM,"A Socialist government is primarily concerned with the Morale and well-being of civilians, and otherwise takes a balanced approach to matters of Production and Growth. Diplomatically, Socialist governments favor other governments which have an emphasis on Morale, but are diplomatically wary of alliances with Production/Control governments which favor Communalism, Junta or Plutocratic values. Domestically, Socialist societies suffer some reduction of the tax base and production efficiency. Citizens gain Morale from signed peace treaties, but suffer Morale consequences from loss of civilian lives, as when Planets are lost or Bio-weapons are used. They enjoy a slight boost to Population growth and research efficiency. They also have a gift for bureaucracy, which allows them to add an additional Planet when organizing Provinces and Territories. DIPLOMATIC EFFECTS: Increased positive relations to other Morale governments. Increased negative relations to other Production governments. NEGATIVE EFFECTS: Decreased tax income and production. Increased negative morale from planet loss. Increased chance of negative ship design attribute. POSITIVE EFFECTS: Increased positive morale from signed peace treaties. Increased population growth and research efficiency. Decreased losses when attacked with Bio-weapons.",
GOV_DESC_COOPERATIVISM,"A Cooperative government has three priorities greater than all others: the Morale and well-being of civilians, the greatest personal freedom for the general population, and peaceful co-existence with other sentients and Factions. Diplomatically, Cooperative governments are friendly to other Cooperatives, as well as Anarchist and Socialist governments. They are repulsed by all governments which emphasize Production/Control. Domestically, Cooperatives are immune to the Morale effects of Debt, but suffer enormous Morale losses when civilians are killed and some Morale losses from overharvesting. They enjoy high growth rates among the civilian population and increased research efficiency, as well as an increased chance to make breakthroughs in research. DIPLOMATIC EFFECTS: Increased positive relations to Socialist, Anarchist, and other Cooperative governments. Additional positive relations if Cooperative government is not same faction. Increased negative relations with Production governments. No effect on Mercantilist and Liberationist governments. NEGATIVE EFFECTS: Decreased tax income. Decreased production penalties. POSITIVE EFFECTS: Immune to morale effects from debt. Increased research efficiency and chance of breakthrough in research. Increased population growth. Improved biosphere effects. GENERAL EFFECT: Increased chance of ship design attributes, positive and negative.",
GOV_DESC_ANARCHISM,"An Anarchist government is primarily concerned with individual liberty, personal choice, and non-violent solutions to potential conflict, both foreign and domestic. Anarchist governments invest heavily in diplomacy and alien habitats, and research paths which yield better understanding of all cultures and diplomatically have no biases based on race. They heavily favor partnerships with other Growth governments and Independent races, but are also favorable toward Socialist and Mercantilist factions. They look less kindly on Production/Control governments. Domestically, Anarchist societies suffer from inefficiency in production, reduction of tax base, and problems in the prototyping ships. DIPLOMATIC EFFECTS: Increased negative relations with Production governments. Increased positive relations with other Growth governments and Independents. Additional positive relations with Mercantilist and Socialist governments. NEGATIVE EFFECTS: Increased prototyping time and cost. Decreased production penalties. Decreased tax income and ability to spy. POSITIVE EFFECTS: Decreased negative morale effects during Peace. Increased population growth. Increased chance of breakthroughs in research. GENERAL EFFECT: Increased chance of ship design attributes, positive and negative.",
GOV_DESC_LIBERATIONISM,"Liberationist governments have three primary concerns: freedom of choice, mutual tolerance, and pursuit of profit and financial gain. Although they invest in diplomatic solutions and research, they also invest significant time and resources in developing trade and profit ventures. Diplomatically, Liberationist governments are truly neutral, and have no biases for or against other Government Types and factions of any other Race. Domestically, Liberationist societies suffer heavy Morale losses from Debt and increased Morale effects during war-time. There are also penalties to production and the tax base. They gain positive Morale from the formation of new colonies, however, and are more resilient during peace time. Due to rigorously defended free market economy, building costs are much reduced. DIPLOMATIC EFFECTS: None. NEGATIVE EFFECTS: Increased negative morale effects from debt and during wars. Decreased production penalties and tax income. POSITIVE EFFECTS: Decreased cost to build. Increased chance of positive ship design attributes. Decreased negative morale effects during peace.",
GOV_DESC_MERCANTILISM,"The primary concern of a Mercantilist government is Trade and financial gain, with an otherwise balanced approach to matters of production and growth. Diplomatically, Mercantilist governments are averse to Communalist governments, but otherwise have no special biases for or against other races or Government Types. Domestically, Mercantilist societies are hard on the environment and are very vulnerable to Morale effects from all known causes. They have an increased income and reduced costs to develop Trade, however. There are also reduced time and costs for Prototyping, and some significant advantages in both Salvage operations and Spying. DIPLOMATIC EFFECTS: Increased negative relations with Communalist governments. NEGATIVE EFFECTS: Increased bio-sphere losses. Increased tax income. Susceptible to being spied on. POSITIVE EFFECTS: Increased trade income. Reduced time and cost when prototyping. Increased chance to salvage and breakthroughs in research. Improved spying.",
GOV_DESC_PLUTOCRACY,"A Plutocracy is a government primarily concerned with production, control and profit. Significant resources are expended to increase Trade and production. The government also tends to assert military control over territory and the civilian population. Diplomatically, Plutocratic governments are not concerned with race, but are averse to relationships with all Morale type governments. They are slightly more inclined to deal with governments which favor Money/Trade. Domestically, Plutocratic societies suffer heavy Morale losses from Debt. They cause serious environmental degradation, and suffer greatly increased costs during prototyping and when pushing research or development. They have an increased tax base at all times, production bonuses at all times, and trade bonuses for all allies at war. DIPLOMATIC EFFECTS: Increased negative relations with Morale governments. Increased positive relations with all Money governments. NEGATIVE EFFECTS: Increased bio-sphere damage. Decreased Psi potential, salvage, and chance of breakthroughs in research. Increased time to prototyping. POSITIVE EFFECTS: Increased tax income, always. Increased production.",
GOV_DESC_JUNTA,"The single overriding concern of a Junta government is control, whether it be over territory, production, or its own population. Beyond this the government tends to take a balanced approach to issues of Morale and Money. Diplomatically, Juntas tend to be extremely racist and isolationist, disinclined to engage diplomatically with any race other than their own, and repulsed by any government which is not a Plutocracy or another Junta. Domestically, the people of a Junta are hard-working, dedicated, and inured to violence as a way of life. The labor force has increased production at all times, but they will work even harder and pay more taxes during a declared war. The population is more insulated from Morale effects when a war has been declared as well, and enjoys a Morale boost when planets are captured. They have a tendency to degrade their environment, however, and suffer Morale losses from military defeat, in particular the loss of a symbolic vessel such as the Leviathan. DIPLOMATIC EFFECTS: Increased negative relations with all government types except Plutocracy and Junta. No effect on Plutocracy relations. Increased positive relations with other Junta governments. NEGATIVE EFFECTS: Increased bio-sphere damage. Decreased chance of salvage. Decreased production bonus from Overharvest. POSITIVE EFFECTS: Decreased morale effects during declared war. GENERAL EFFECT: Increased chance of ship design attributes, positive and negative.",
